This script simulates a quantum computer by applying unitary transformations, represented as matrices, to a quantum state, represented as a complex valued vector. For instance, a quantum circuit may be represented with the following sequence of gates, Hadamard on the first qubit, Hadamard on the third qubit and a controlled not from the first to the second qubit. The string associated with this circuit would be: C(1,2)H(1)H(3). The output is each component of the the vector that represents the quantum state.
